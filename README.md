# Predator VS Prey

Because I am trash, the program loads the font from `C:\arial.ttf`, so just whack it there, or just change the path it loads before you compile it. Stuff like that wasn't the focus of doing this, it was to get some basics down with C++ and SFML.

It's not perfect but it works, nor is it particularly good C++ most likely, as it's my first project in it. Hopefully I'll be able to take this and apply it to some more stuff
