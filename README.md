# Predator VS Prey
A very basic implementation of the predator vs prey cellula-autonoma. I developed this to familiarise myself with C++ and learn how to use SFML.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler
- SFML Library

## Compilation
- Load the project in Visual Studio
- Ensure SFML is downloaded and linked to the project
- Compile and run .exe
